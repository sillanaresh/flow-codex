//
//   - session-start: wired as a Codex SessionStart hook so that
//     every session start (fresh spawn AND resume) re-injects the
//     "load your task context" instruction. Without it, resumed
//     sessions never re-read briefs and updates that may have been
//     edited since the previous session.
//
//   - user-prompt-submit: wired as a UserPromptSubmit hook. Fires on
//     every user prompt; in ad-hoc sessions (FLOW_TASK unset) it
//     reminds Codex to invoke the flow skill before responding so the
//     §4.14 substantive-work check actually runs. In bound sessions
//     (FLOW_TASK set) it no-ops; the SessionStart context already
//     covers the bound case.

//     force the agent to re-read potentially-updated briefs and updates.
//   - $FLOW_TASK unset (ad-hoc session, e.g. bare `codex`): emit a
//     short hint that the flow skill is installed and should be used
//     when the request touches task / project / session management.
